Introduction to Computing project - Enter your zipcode to find your weather!
This project was done as an assignment for my CS105 (Introduction to Computing) class during my Fall 2016 semester at U of I.
Attached are the index.html, starterCode.js, and stylesheet.css files. These 3 files are all it took to build a decent wepbage which allows users to enter a zipcode to find out about the current weather.
